# Main Features

1. **Bulk Scoring**

        Enter a uniform score for all students with a single click. Simply type the score in the available field and press **"Apply"**, the system will automatically fill in the score fields for all students simultaneously — very useful for exams with standardized grading weights.

2. **Interactive Student List**

        Automatically display student names and sequence:

        * Total number of students (e.g., **32 students**)
        * Automatic and alphabetic numbering
        * Individual score fields that can be changed at any time as needed

        This view makes it easier for educators to monitor and correct student grade entries one by one.

3. **Submit Results**

        Once the scoring process is complete, teachers can directly press the **"Submit Results"** button to:

        * Save and archive scores
        * Send scores to the central system or homeroom teacher
        * Ensure all score data has been submitted correctly

        This action indicates that the scoring process has been completed with final validation.
