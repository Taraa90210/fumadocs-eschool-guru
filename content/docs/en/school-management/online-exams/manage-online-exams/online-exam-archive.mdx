        Easily search for specific exams from the archive list using keywords for the exam name, subject, or date. This feature is very useful for tracking old exams that you want to access again.

2. **Archive Date Filter**

        Set a date range to display only exams that fall within a specific time period. This helps speed up searching when dealing with large amounts of exam data.

3. **Flexibly Manage Archives**

        For each archived exam, users can:

        * **Restore Exam** — Reactivate archived exams for editing or reuse.
        * **Delete Permanently** — Thoroughly remove the exam from the system if it is no longer needed.
