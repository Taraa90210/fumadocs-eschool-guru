## Manage and Monitor Teacher Payroll Practically and Transparently

With this feature, users can directly view the **payment status** of each teacher (paid or unpaid), check **base salary**, **net salary**, and detailed **allowances, deductions**, as well as **holiday information** such as entitlements and remaining active holiday.

In addition, admins can also perform **salary adjustments** directly from the interface, ranging from editing amounts, adding or subtracting allowance-deduction components, to completing the salary disbursement process in bulk or individually. All is done in just a few simple steps, while maintaining accuracy and transparency.
