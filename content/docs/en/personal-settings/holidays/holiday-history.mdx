# **Main Features**

1. **Monthly Holiday Quota Summary**

        The holiday summary section displays two key pieces of information:

        * **Holiday Quota**: Total holiday allocation for the current month
        * **Remaining Holiday**: Holiday days that have not yet been used

        A horizontal visual bar indicator is displayed below it to provide a quick overview of holiday usage progress.

2. **Holiday Application History**

        All holiday application data is well-documented and displayed chronologically:

        * Automated application number
        * Holiday application dates (single day or date range)
        * Application information displayed concisely yet informatively

        Example:

            > **1. Tuesday, July 15, 2025**\
            > **2. Tuesday, July 15, 2025 – Wednesday, July 16, 2025**

        The total number of holiday days applied for in a month is also summarized in small labels such as **"2 Holidays"**.

3. **Filter by Year and Month**

        Users can filter history data based on:

        * **Academic Year**
        * **Month**

        This feature is very helpful for tracking annual data, checking remaining holiday between months, and ensuring compliance with company policies.
