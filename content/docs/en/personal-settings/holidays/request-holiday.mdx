# **Main Features**

1. **Select Holiday Period**

        Users can flexibly determine their holiday time through two date inputs:

        * **Start Date**: Determine the first day of holiday.
        * **End Date**: Select the last day of the holiday period.

        The system will automatically record the holiday duration based on the selected dates to facilitate administrative approval.

2. **Supporting Document Attachment (Optional)**

        Options are available to attach additional files such as:

        * Doctor's certificate
        * Travel proof
        * External assignment letter

        This feature helps speed up the verification process without the need for additional manual confirmation.

3. **Send Holiday Request with One Tap**

        Once all data is filled in, the user simply presses the **"Send Holiday"** button to:

        * Submit the request to the internal system
        * Mark the holiday request in the employment data history
        * Start the approval process by the relevant parties

        A notification will be received once the submission has been successfully sent.
