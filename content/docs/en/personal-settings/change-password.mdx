## Enhance Your Account Security with a Stronger, Encrypted Password

The **Change Password** menu is set up to make it easy for users to update their login credentials securely and intuitively. With a user-friendly interface and an interactive password strength indicator, users can ensure their account protection remains optimal.

1. **Real-Time Security Indicator**

        As the user types a new password, the system automatically assesses its strength level through a gradual indicator:

        * **Weak**
        * **Medium**
        * **Strong**
        * **Very Strong**

        This helps users understand how strong the password they created is before confirming it.

2. **Password Requirements**

        To maintain security, the system only accepts passwords that meet the following criteria:

        * Minimum **8 characters**
        * Contains **uppercase letters** (A–Z)
        * Contains **lowercase letters** (a–z)
        * Contains **numbers** (0–9)
        * Contains **special characters** (!@#$%^&)
        * **No consecutive repeating characters**

        These criteria are displayed visually and will be automatically checked when met.

3. **Password Confirmation Form**

        After entering a **new password**, users are required to re-enter it in the **confirm password** field. This prevents typos that could hinder account access.

4. **Validation and Save Process**

        Action buttons like **"Complete All Fields"** will remain inactive until all requirements and entries are valid. Once everything is met, users can immediately save the changes and update their password.

5. **Privacy Protection**

        To ensure additional security, the password field is hidden by default. Users can display characters if needed using the eye view icon.
