**Special Monitoring for Students with Highest Absence Rates**

The **Highest Alpha Points** menu is a special monitoring feature in the eSchool Mobile application that displays **student rankings based on the highest accumulated absenteeism (alpha)** over a certain period. This feature supports discipline evaluation and student coaching quickly and focused.

# Key Features:

1. **Ranking Based on Alpha Count**\
    The system automatically sorts students based on the number of unauthorized absences (without explanation). Alpha values ​​are displayed in numeric and visual formats.
2.   **Highlight Bottom Students (Highest Violations)**\
    Rankings 1–3 are given special markers because they fall into the highest attendance violation category.

      > Example:\
      > Achmad Marvel Davinsyah — **166 alpha**\
      > Ghale Abid Rahmadhani — **123 alpha**\
      > Raditya Abiyuazmi Ataya — **109 alpha**
3. **Filter by Class & Level**\
    Users can filter data by class or level to review more specifically (e.g. only class XII or TKJ only).
3. **Sequential Visual Display**\
    Each student is displayed complete with:
    * Name and class
    * Total alpha points
    * Ranking position
    * Gradient color according to violation level

# Benefits:

1. Help counseling teachers, homeroom teachers, and school management in:
    * Identifying students who need special coaching
    * Taking preventive actions before grades and discipline decline further
    * Preparing violation report data for meetings, committees, or summons letters
2. Encourage openness and awareness of **student attendance levels objectively**

## Notes:

1. Alpha points are total absences **without official explanation**.
2. This feature **is not intended to shame**, but rather as a faster and more directed intervention tool.
3. **Rank 1–3** are marked as indicators of students with **most critical** absenteeism
