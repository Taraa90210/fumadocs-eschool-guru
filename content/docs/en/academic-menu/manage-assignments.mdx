## Full Control over Assignment Creation, Settings, and Monitoring

The **Manage Assignments** menu is designed to provide ease for educators in compiling, scheduling, and managing all student assignment activities efficiently and completely. An intuitive and systematic interface helps users to set assignment parameters clearly and structured.

# **Key Features**

1. **Assignment Schedule**

    Set the assignment period by determining:

    * **Assignment start & end date**

   This makes it easier for teachers to manage the learning rhythm and ensure students are disciplined about deadlines.

    Flexible grading system that allows settings:

    * **Maximum Points** — highest total score obtainable
    * **Minimum Points** — passing grade threshold
    * **Support for assignment resubmission** (if enabled)

3. **Answer Types**

    Choose the method students use to answer:

    * **Text** — type the answer directly
    * **File** — upload documents with allowed formats such as PDF, DOCX, JPEG, and others

4. **Assignment Attachments**

    Add supporting files (PDF, JPEG, DOCX, MP4, etc.) as references or supplementary material sources with a configurable maximum size limit per file (e.g. 2MB).

5. **Assignment Publication**

    With a single touch of the **"Create Assignment"** button, teachers can:

    * Publish assignments to specific classes or students
    * Review all parameters before sending

# Assignment Details
