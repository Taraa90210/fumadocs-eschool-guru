## Monitor Student Exam Progress Live and in Detail

The **Student Exam Status** menu allows teachers and supervisors to monitor student exam implementation in real-time with informative and easy-to-understand visuals. From total participants, current activities, to completion, everything is presented in one integrated screen.

# Key Features

1. **Automatic Statistical Summary**

        Right at the top, indicators of the number of students in several categories are available:

        * **Total** students registered to take the exam
        * **Active**: students who are currently working on the exam in real-time
        * **Finished**: students who have completely finished the exam

        These statistics speed up the monitoring process without having to open the details of each student.

2. **Complete & Interactive Student List**

        Each student is displayed in a special card containing:

        * **Initials & Full Name** of student
        * **Class** of student
        * Individual status: ✅ **Finished** or ⏳ **Not Yet**
        * **Delete** icon to cancel or remove students from the exam if needed

        The list can be sorted by **Name**, providing flexibility in student data management.

3. **Student Name Search**

        Use the search feature to find specific students quickly by name. Very practical when there are many exam participants and you want to access specific data without long scrolling.

4. **Adaptive & Efficient Design**

        With high-contrast status colors and intuitive icons, this menu is built so teachers can understand and follow up on exam conditions in seconds. Every element is designed to facilitate decision-making while exams are in progress.
