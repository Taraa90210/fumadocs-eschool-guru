## Input, Organize, and Report Exam Scores Quickly and Accurately

The **Offline Exam Results** menu facilitates teachers in conducting efficient assessments for every student taking exams face-to-face. With a clean and systematic interface, the process of filling, changing, to sending grades is done in one screen without obstacles.

# **Key Features**

1. **Bulk Grading**

    Enter uniform scores for all students with a single click. Simply type the score in the available column and press **"Apply"**, the system will automatically fill in the score column for all students simultaneously — very useful for exams that have standard weightings.

2. **Interactive Student List**

    Display student names and sequences automatically:

    * Total number of students (example: **32 students**)
    * Automatic and alphabetical numbering
    * Individual score columns that can be changed at any time as needed

    This view makes it easier for educators to monitor and correct student score input one by one.

3. **Send Results**

    After the grading process is complete, teachers can directly press the **“Send Results”** button to:

    * Save and archive grades
    * Send grades to the central system or homeroom teacher
    * Ensure all grade data has been sent correctly

    This action marks that the grading process has been completed with final validation.
