## Our Commitment to Education Data Security

**eSchool** is an integrated Software as a Service (SaaS) based platform used by thousands of schools to manage academic activities, administration, and communication. Security is a primary principle in the development of all our services — from systems and human resources to operational processes.

1. **Organizational Security**

        We implement an **Information Security Management System (ISMS)** that refers to industrial best practices in educational technology. This system considers our security objectives as well as risks that may impact schools, teachers, students, and parents who are active eSchool users.

2. **Core Security Principles**

        Some core principles we hold:

        * **Data Confidentiality**: User personal information will not be shared with third parties without permission.
        * **Data Integrity**: All academic and administrative data is protected from manipulation or unauthorized access.
        * **System Availability**: eSchool operates with high uptime and a reliable backup system.

3. **Our Team's Background Checks**

        All development and system support staff at eSchool have undergone a selection process and **background verification**, including professional and educational records. This ensures that only trusted personnel have access to school and user data.

4. **Transparency and Compliance**

        We continuously update our security policies in accordance with educational and digital technology regulations applicable in Indonesia. We are open to security audits and feedback from school partners to create a safe, comfortable, and trusted digital environment for all users.
