We **do not sell, share, or monetize personal data** in any form to third parties, including for advertising purposes. Even for the free version of the service, we **have never—and will never—generate revenue from user personal data**.

### The purpose of this policy is to provide transparency to you regarding:

* Types of data collected

We strive to use clear and easy-to-understand language because we believe privacy is a fundamental right of every individual, including in an educational environment.
