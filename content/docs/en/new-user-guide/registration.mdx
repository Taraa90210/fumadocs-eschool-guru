# How to Register and Access eSchool Mobile

**eSchool Mobile** can only be used by schools that have **officially subscribed** through the eSchool team. Users cannot register independently through the application, because the activation process is done centrally by the eSchool team.

## School Registration Steps:

1. Schools register on the [eSchool Siakad website page](https://www.eschool.ac.id/) by clicking the "Register Your School" button.

2. Fill in the school and admin registration form that appears after the button is pressed.

3. After activation, the eSchool admin will:

   * Create a school admin account (for the principal/operator).
   * Provide initial login access.

4. The school admin can then create and manage other user accounts such as:
   * Teachers
   * Students
   * Parents/guardians

5. User accounts will be sent via email or official communication media from the school.

## Access to Mobile Application

* After the account is created by the school admin, **teachers, students, and parents** can **download the eSchool Mobile application** from [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.eschool.ac.id) / [App Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=id.ac.eschool.GuruStaff.android&hl=id).
* Login is done using the **official account shared by the school**.
* After the first successful login, users can directly access features according to their respective roles.

***

## Important to Know

* **No independent registration available** for individuals (teachers/students/parents) through the application.
* The eSchool usage process always **starts from the school**, not individuals.
* If you are a user (teacher, parent, or student) who wants to use eSchool Mobile, please direct your school to **contact the eSchool team** to start the official registration process.
